  <h1> city 56 soldiers. Heavy losses in Ukraine have given the local
    authorities a difficult task of political management.</h1>
 <img src="image/joe.jfif" alt="">
 <p>The loss of life has caused much comment in Kostroma, which lies
   about 300km north-east of Moscow and has a population of around 
   a quarter of a million. One local website noted last spring that
    the entire Soviet-Afghan war, lasting nine years, had cost the 
    city 56 soldiers. Heavy losses in Ukraine have given the local
     authorities a difficult task of political management.
 </p>
 <br>
    <p>Sergey Sitnikov, Kostroma's Kremlin-appointed governor, has been
   in the forefront of attempts to convince people that the city's 
   soldiers are being properly supported. Gov Sitnikov's visits to
    hospitals, barracks, and indeed to the front, have been covered on local TV.
    </p>
    <br>
   <p>On a visit to the front in December, Gov Sitnikov told viewers that
   "we need to help [the] guys so they have decent conditions". He
    had brought with him crowd-funded care packages and commercially sold drones.
   </p>
   <br>
 <p>Gov Sitnikov is Vladimir Putin's placeman in his home region, so he's hardly 
  a rebel or fearless teller of uncomfortable truths. But his willingness to
  an interesting contrast with his boss.
   </p>
   <br>
 <p>When local TV showed mobilised paratroopers on the 331st's parade ground six months 
  ago, it also carried Gov Sitnikov's rather frank remarks to them: "I'm wishing 
  you good health, success, completion of 
   all tasks… and that you return home alive."
